This core part of the project attempts compliance with the [Yarn 2.0 language specification](https://github.com/YarnSpinnerTool/YarnSpinner/blob/9275277f50a6acbe8438b29596acc8527cf5581a/Documentation/Yarn-Spec.md).

Its API is similar to the bondage.js for Yarn 1.x API.

Non-spec features (like markup) should be implemented in a separate layer.

In theory, you could run this alone and have a "vanilla" Yarn 2.0 experience.
