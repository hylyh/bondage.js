This project attempts to be a runner for Yarn dialogues, compliant with the language specification.

This repo is a fork of a [fork](https://github.com/alforno/bondage.js) of [the original](https://github.com/hylyh/bondage.js).

# Known Deviations from Yarn 2.0 spec

- Reading from a .yarn file is left to the user; dialogues should be supplied to bondage.js as a text string or array of node objects.
- Some minutia about what unicode characters define a string has not been considered

There are features in the Yarn docs that are not present in the language spec. These have not been implemented. Known examples are:
  - `Character: some text` lines
  - Markup
  

# Usage

Most 

explain how functions and commands work

explain hashtags and node data
  - mention that options hashtags go on the individual option and node data goes on the options node
